          Dark mode was improved. The signed-in user interface and experience were vastly improved upon. You can check
          out this <a href="/home.html" style="color:blue;">here</a>. With a new <a href="team.html"
            style="color:blue;">team page</a>. Along with changes to the scrollbar. New URL!

          <strong style="font-size:30px;">Dark Mode! (And OAuth stuff)</strong>
          <br>
          <em>11/22/2022 | zedthehedgehog</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks to Looserty, we now have dark mode! You can toggle it with the moon/sun button or by typing "openly".
          We experimented with a sidebar, but that didn't work, so we now have a more optimal topbar. I also added some
          interactive OAuth concepts that you can try out when clicking on "Connect with Meower" in the openly signup
          page. Obviously there's no actualy OAuth and it doesn't create an account (yet). Soon we'll actually get a
          database to store users and posts, but the Meower rewrite is kind of taking most of the spotlight so that
          won't be for a while. Openly might take a backseat for myself soon though thanks to the CL4 port of Meower,
          which I'll have to make a admin panel as client-side admin panels are no longer possible. Anyway enough
          off-topic ramblings!

    <p class="mainbody">
      Special Coding Language
      For snippets of code from special coding languages (such as code that isn't text-based such as scratch) we have
      special editors for Scratch, Snap, or other coding languages that are not text-based, or use special
      characters.<br>
      <b>Non-Profit</b><br>
      It's FREE! Everyone can have fun, and share with everyone!<br>
      <b>No ads!</b><br>
      We think there shouldn't be any distractions in your experience in openly. I mean, we don't want any party-poopers
      right?
